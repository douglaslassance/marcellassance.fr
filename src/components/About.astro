          Marcel Lassance is a fashion designer whose work characterized by a
          minimalist approach and particular attention to detail. His creative
          universe explores the intersection between contemporary fashion and
          traditional craftsmanship, creating timeless pieces that transcend
          fleeting trends. Each creation is the result of deep reflection on form,
          function and aesthetics, giving birth to garments that celebrate the
          beauty of simplicity.

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>
          He approaches the traditional suit with a thoughtful reconsideration
          of structure, gently deconstructing jackets to prioritize comfort and
          natural movement. By removing heavy linings and excessive padding, the
          garments embrace the body's natural form while maintaining meticulous
          interior craftsmanship. The result is a jacket that feels as
          comfortable as a sweater yet retains its refined silhouette.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Materials</h3>
        <p>
          His commitment to natural materials reflects a deep appreciation for
          both quality and sustainability. Working exclusively with noble fibers
          such as wool, cotton, and linen, he seeks fabrics that offer inherent
          comfort and authenticity. Through careful post-production washing,
          each piece develops a lived-in softness that embodies his signature
          understated elegance.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Colors</h3>
        <p>
          He thoughtfully explores a broader spectrum of colors in menswear,
          challenging conventional boundaries with quiet confidence. His palette
          includes nuanced bronze-green blazers, subtle purple knitwear, and
          even a cherry-toned duffle coat, demonstrating that masculinity can be
          expressed through a richer range of hues than tradition might suggest.
